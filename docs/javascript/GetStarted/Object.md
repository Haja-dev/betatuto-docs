## Overview.

In JavaScript, an **object** is a collection of properties, where each property is a key-value pair. The value of a property can be any JavaScript data type, including strings, numbers, booleans, functions, and other objects.

An object in JavaScript is a collection of related data and/or functionality, represented as key-value pairs. It provides a way to organize and structure code by grouping related variables and functions together.

Objects are commonly used to represent real-world entities such as people, products, or events, and can be used to store and manipulate data, as well as define behaviors and methods.

In JavaScript, objects are mutable and dynamic, meaning their properties can be modified and new properties can be added or removed at runtime. They can also be passed as arguments to functions, returned from functions, and used as prototypes to create new objects.
